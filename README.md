# Easy ColdFusion Stripe Examples
Super simple Cold Fusion examples for integrating into Stripe

Since there is a lack of Cold Fusion documentation on the Stripe.com site, here you will find 2 simple examples to use for integrating Cold Fusion into Stripe.  

One merely charges a customer.  The other, creates a customer in stripe (that you can leverage to additional charges later), and charges that customer.

I hope you will find these examples useful for integrating your own Cold Fusion projects into Stripe.
